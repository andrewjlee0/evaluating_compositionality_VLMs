        Each image contains multiple objects with relations between them, and belongs to one of two categories (0 or 1).
        The categories are based on the pattern of relations between the objects.
        Your job is to learn to correctly classify the images.
        After viewing a series of images, you will be presented with a target image and asked to classify it.

        Each image contains multiple objects with relations between them, and belongs to one of two categories (0 or 1).
        The categories are based on the pattern of relations between the objects.
        Your job is to learn to correctly classify the images.
        After viewing a series of images, you will be presented with a target image and asked to classify it.
